### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Soner Mezgitci and Iâ€™m a creative software engineer and problem solver with experience in Ruby & Rails, JavaScript and React. With a background in sports and real estate, I utilize data and cross-functional collaboration to build compelling product experiences and assist with implementing abstract ideas that make sense to people and organizations so that they can help people communicate and interact.

My background actually begins as an athlete. I have been playing for Turkish Men Volleyball team for 10 years. I won 10 times Turkish National Championship 10 times and won a gold medal in the University Olympic games in 2005. I used to work as a Real Estate Agent for a while but I decided to transition into tech!.
